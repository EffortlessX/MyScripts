Effortless X - Roblox Exploits


Universal Gui (in development):

The Universal Gui was made to easily use exploits on Roblox.
You can use the gui by executing the line
`loadstring(game.HttpGet("https://github.com/EffortlessX/MyScripts/blob/main/UniversalGui"))()`
and use its functions to customize the gui to your liking.

Universal Exploits (in development):

I've made Roblox exploits myself too, which can easily be accessed
using the Universal Exploits. When executed, it will check what game
you are playing and use the Universal Gui to let you use the exploit.
Currently there are exploits for:
- Arsenal (Patched)
- Jailbreak (Patched)


This project is still in development!
