How to use the Universal Gui.

Setup:

1. Load the gui using `loadstring(game.HttpGet("https://github.com/EffortlessX/MyScripts/blob/main/UniversalGui"))()`.
2. Wait until the gui has loaded using `repeat wait() until _G.EffortlessXLoaded`.


Customization:

You can easily customize the gui with premade functions. These functions are stored in `_G.EffortlessXFunctions`.
It is recommend to define that as a variable, as it can be annoying to write that for every function you call.
Example:
```loadstring(game.HttpGet("https://github.com/EffortlessX/MyScripts/blob/main/UniversalGui"))()
repeat wait() until _G.EffortlessXLoaded
local Functions = _G.EffortlessXFunctions
Functions.CreateRow("Toggle","This is a toggle row.")```
